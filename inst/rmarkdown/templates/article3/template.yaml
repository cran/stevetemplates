description: >
   'An article/manuscript template patterned lightly off Elsevier templates. Its design aims to maximize information in the abstract section of the paper, which the user may find useful. It is also optimized for any type of submission in which the journal (for one reason or the other) insists on having author *addresses* in the title page.'
